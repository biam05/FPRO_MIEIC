# DESCRIPTION of exercise 5: 
#
#   Write a program that, given two numbers n1 and n2 provided by the user 
#   (each one in a different input() statement) produces a new number result 
#   from the concatenation of both of them, in the order they are given. 
#   See Google Docs for implementation details.
#
# Do NOT alter the function prototype given
#
# PASTE your code inside the function block below, paying atention to the right indentation
#
# Don't forget that your program should use the return keyword in the last instruction 
# to return the appropriate value
